Vishakha Roy — Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

A modern, animated developer portfolio built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a touch of Three.js (via @react-three/fiber + @react-three/drei).
It includes smooth reveal animations, a starfield theme, a Project Details modal with a mobile-friendly layout, and a 3D desk scene in the contact section.

✨ Features

Clean dark theme with starfield background and glassy cards

Responsive layout (desktop → tablet → mobile)

Hero with rotating skill headline and avatar tilt effect

Marquee skills strip (same background as the intro to avoid visible gaps)

Skills / Experience / Education / Hackathons / Courses sections with subtle 3D & reveal effects

Projects grid with click-to-open Project Details modal

Carousel with arrows + dots

Mobile top Close (X) always visible

Sticky bottom CTA (“View Code”, “View Live”) always reachable on mobile

Contact section with a 3D desk scene

Scene height matches the contact form

Rounded corners and background color tuned to the layout

Accessibility touches (focus states, aria labels, keyboard Esc to close modal)

Easy to extend project data (projectsData) and section content

🧰 Tech Stack

React (Hooks, functional components)

Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)

Lucide React (icons)

@react-three/fiber & @react-three/drei (3D canvas)

Vite (recommended dev server & bundler)

You can use CRA as well, but Vite provides a faster dev experience.

📁 Project Structure (suggested)
.
├─ public/
│  └─ Vishu.jpeg                 # avatar (example)
├─ src/
│  ├─ components/
│  │  └─ ProjectDetails.tsx      # modal with carousel + mobile sticky CTA
│  ├─ App.jsx                    # main page sections
│  ├─ main.jsx                   # React entry
│  ├─ index.css                  # Tailwind directives & custom CSS
│  └─ styles.css                 # (if you keep separate custom CSS)
├─ tailwind.config.js
├─ postcss.config.js
├─ index.html
└─ package.json


If you’re using JavaScript instead of TypeScript, simply rename ProjectDetails.tsx to ProjectDetails.jsx and remove interfaces.

⚙️ Setup

Clone & install

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo>
npm install


Run the dev server

npm run dev


Vite will print a local URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

Build for production

npm run build


Preview production build (optional)

npm run preview

🧩 Tailwind Config

Ensure you have the basic Tailwind setup:

index.css (or src/index.css)

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Your custom CSS (from styles you pasted) can live here or in a separate file */


tailwind.config.js

export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
};


postcss.config.js

export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
